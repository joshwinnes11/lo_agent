# Loan Officer Agent
*This project is still very much in progress*

Rumor has it that MCP's are the future... This is my first MCP project totally from scratch. The goal is to build an MCP that allows an AI Agent to generate and send out quotes for Loan Officers. So far, the capabilities include:
- being able to look up the list price of a house

There is still a long way to go! I can't wait to see how this turns out!
